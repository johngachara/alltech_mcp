# ðŸ“ˆ Alltech MCP (Model Context Protocol)

Originally, this project started as a standalone MCP (Model context protocol) server + client setup.  
After some challenges integrating with the OpenAI SDK â€” and with OpenAI now allowing **direct tool integrations** â€”  
the system was restructured and simplified.

Instead of a full custom server and client, the MCP logic is now built **directly into the  openai sdk**.  
This keeps it lightweight, faster to deploy, and easier to extend.
